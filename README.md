# Data-Wrangling-Analysis-and-Visualization
Here, I worked on a dataset of an e-commerce firm in the USA. Basically to glean out insights as well as draw inferences.

I have two files, one focusing on Data wrangling i.e., cleaning and refining the datasets in order to be able to do some analysis on the dataset. The other file contains data visualization, descriptive and diagnostic analysis of the dataset.

I am open to corrections or suggestions of a better way this could have been done.

Thank you
